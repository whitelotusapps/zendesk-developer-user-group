The hello-world folder contains a simple app that shows how to display text within an HTML iframe in the Zendesk agent workspace

The xr_app is a sample app provided by Zendesk themselves, and illustrates how to obtain user information via the API and display that
within the agent workspace. (https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/build-an-app/build-your-first-support-app/part-1-laying-the-groundwork/)

The list group Python files are used to illustrate how an API call can be made and how to extract data from a JSON response. One of these files contains comments to illustrate what is going on, and the other file does not, and is easier to read if one is interested only in reviewing the code.
