# Welcome to the Zendesk Developer User Group central repo!

## NOTES:
- This repo is created and maintained by [Zack Olinger](https://github.com/whitelotusapps) for the purpose of providing an open resource for those who are interested; with the primary audience being users within the [Zendesk Developer User Group](https://usergroups.zendesk.com/developer-user-group/).
- All of the code here is AS-IS; it is the express responsibility of any party to test and verify any code that may be available on this site
- We will attempt our best to note which apps and/or scripts perform READ ONLY / WRITE ONLY / READ & WRITE to a Zendesk instance
- All transcripts and summaries are AI generated, and not thoroughly edited (if edited at all)
## Community Developed Apps:
- [User Reports](https://github.com/whitelotusapps/user-reports)
  - This app will likely not work on instances that have thousands of users; see the below info regarding time to load for the Agent Reports app
- [Agent Reports](https://github.com/whitelotusapps/agent-reports)
  - Specifically designed to search only for Admin and Agent users
  - As of 2023-06-13, there have been reports of about 3 to 5 minute load times with a few hundred agents
- [Collaborators App](https://github.com/whitelotusapps/collaborators-app)
  - Add unique tags to Zendesk tickets that allow you to create views based on the collaborators on the ticket
